# Company-Database-SQL-Server-
We start with a Database that can store company names and organization numbers for different companies.
Each company can have one or more departments, for which only department names are stored.
For the employees, the first and last name, department, salary, and whether they are part of a union are stored as true or false.
An employee can have several positions (eg Manager, Marketer) and one position can be held by several employees.
Stored Procedures are implemented, that perform CRUD operations in the tables as well as Transactions and error handling in the stored procedures that change, add, and remove data in the tables.
